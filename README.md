# Highridge-Payroll-Assignment
I created a list of 400 workers using variables and a loop to generate their payment slips. Within the loop, I applied conditions: salaries between $10,000–$20,000 were assigned level "A1," while female workers earning $7,500–$30,000 were set to "A5-F." I also added exception handling to manage errors.
