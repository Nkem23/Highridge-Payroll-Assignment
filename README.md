## Project Title: Highridge-Payroll-project
### Description: Creating a payroll slip for 400 workers of Highridge Construction
In my program, I created a list of workers dynamically, making sure there were at least 400 workers. I used a for loop to generate payment slips for each of these workers. Within the loop, I added conditions to assign employee levels: if a workerâ€™s salary is between $10,000 and $20,000, I set their level to "A1", and if the worker is female with a salary between $7,500 and $30,000, I set their level to "A5-F". I also included exception handling so that any potential errors, like KeyError, NameError, TypeError, are properly managed.

### Code Execution
